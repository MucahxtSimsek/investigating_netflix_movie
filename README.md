ðŸŽ¬ Investigating Netflix Movies
This project is part of my Python learning journey, applying core programming, data analysis, and data visualization skills using real-world Netflix movie data. The goal is to explore key trends and insights that help understand the Netflix movie landscape.

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of Netflix movies to uncover patterns related to:

Movie release trends over the years

Relationship between genre and movie ratings

Distribution of movie durations

Filtering out non-movie content (e.g., TV shows)

Identifying standout movies based on rating or other features

ðŸ§  Key Skills Practiced
Working with lists, dictionaries, and functions

Applying conditional logic and loops

Using Matplotlib for data visualization

Performing data filtering and selection

ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
Python (Core Language)

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib

Basic data handling with built-in structures (no Pandas)
